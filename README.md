# Fetch Jobs Project

Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lauywdXKEXI from CodeDrip.

Project that fetches jobs from the ItJobs API, using cron from hour to hour and persist them in a redis server. It uses a express + node API to fetch the jobs from the redis server.
React Client app created using create-react-app.
Using react hooks.

## What I Learned with the project:

## Redis:

The basics of the basics and the advantages of an in memory database (cache).

## React:

Learned the basics of using react without class components. Using functions components with react hooks.
Need to learn more about react hooks in the future and how is used with redux. Since react hooks are going to be the standard, when react suspense is stable. Substituting class components.

## Express:

Nothing, only a simple get request is made.
